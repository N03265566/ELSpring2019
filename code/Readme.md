This is where I put my programs and code

### Assignment 3

First I set up the sqlite3 database and data table so that the program has somewhere to store the data. Once that's established I implemented a sleep timer to read the temperature every 60 seconds and blink with a for loop. I printed out all of the data in the data table and used the clear function to wipe the console.
